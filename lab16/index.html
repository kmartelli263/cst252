        <h2> Subject </h2>
        <p> The objective of this lab was to create an output using jquery. I
          am still getting used to jquery and all you can do with libraries,
          but so far it seems neat!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <h2> Difficulties </h2>
        <p> I thought this lab was pretty straight forward and I didn't have
          too much difficulty with it. My lab partner Tylet, put some helpful
          tips and resources for the Javascript in his lab for me to reference
          which helped!
        </p>

      <div class="column">
        <h2> Results </h2>
        <p> The results of this lab is you end up with a cool input when you
          click on the button and then this allows you to change the color of
          the button. In this case the color green.
