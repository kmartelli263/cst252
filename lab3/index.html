	<h1> Lab 3: File Structures </h1>
	<h2> Objective </h2>
	<p> The idea of this lab was for us to create a group of files locally on our
		computer that will hold all of the content for our future labs. There will
		be a folder for each lab and within each folder will be multiple folders
		in which have files for out HTML, CSS, and our images. </p>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> I had no pronlems with creating the HTML and CSS files for this lab. It
		was a good refresher lab for me to get back in the groove of things for
		this semester. I also enjoyed creating a new homepage and styling it with
		new photos and colors from last semester. </p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> Here you have the files that I created providing you with a photo of
		what my new, updated homepage looks like. I also included screenshots
		of what the page looks like for my lab. Overall I enjoyed this lab.
