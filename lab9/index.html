  		<h1> Lab 9: JavaScript for the web </h1>
  		<h2> Challenges </h2>
      <p> I had some challenges with getting my JavaScript to show up correctly
      on my HTML page. After talking with my partner about it and seeking help
      from the Google I have finally got my JavaScript to output and display
      on my page.</p>
      <h2> Problems </h2>
  		<p> I have a problem with the output element where it kept saying the
        input in the console was not valid nor was my document. I eventually
      debugged this with the help of the Google and got it working.</p>
      <h2> Results </h2>
  		<p> The results of this lab and posted below showing the outputs that I
      have created within JavaScript.</p>
