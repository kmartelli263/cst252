		<h1> Lab 7: Functions </h1>
		<h2> Challenges </h2>
    <p> I had some challenges with getting my JavaScript to show up on my
    HTML page. After talking with my partner about it I think I have
  found the problem. I did not define my callout and had no strings.</p>
    <h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> I am going to fix my JavaScript and re-submit my screenshots once
    I am able to get things working.</p>
    <h2> Results </h2>
		<p> I have not gotten my JavaScript code to work yet, so I am not sure
    what the results will look like. I will edit this section tomorrow,
  when I re-submit my JavaScript.</p>
