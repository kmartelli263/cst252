		<h1> Lab 6: Arrays and Objects </h1>
		<img src="img/toyota.jpg">
		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> I surprisingly didn't have any trouble completing a majority of the lab.
		I have found it to be kind of fun to create these arrays and objects that
	have input's and output's. I did have a little bit of trouble with typing
in the input values on the console. I think it may have been user error,
but I'm not sure if I did that part correctly. </p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> I did not have any problems while completing this lab. I am enjoying
		learning new things with JavaScript and I am quickely realizing that
	some of the terminology seems to be math related. Eeek! </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> The results of this lab gives you an output table that displays
		the inputs from your JavaScript file. I think it's kind of cool to put
		in data and information into arrays and then to have the outcome to be
		displayed on your web page. Sort of rewarding! </p>
