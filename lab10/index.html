		<h1> Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms </h1>

    <h2> Challenges </h2>
    <p> I surprisingly did not have much trouble while working ont this
    lab. I feel like this is one of the first lectures since the beginning
    of the semester that i have felt like I really understood what we were
    doing. I have had a rough start to the semester, but I'm hanging in
    there.</p>

    <h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> the only problem that I had while completing this lab was with
    input field above the button. I'm not sure if we were supposed to make
    it so that when we typed stuff in and hit the button it does something.
    If so, then i was not able to get that feature working. </p>

    <h2> Results </h2>
		<p> The results of this lab gives you a "search bar" that you are able
    to input words into and then there is a button placed below that field.</p>
  <div class="text-infront-button">
    <p>My name is <input type="text" id="input"></p>
  </div>
    <button id="myButton" class="fancy-button">
      Press me.
    </button>
  </div>
