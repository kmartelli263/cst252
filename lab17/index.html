		<h1>Lab 17: Advanced jQuery</h1>

		<div id="challenge">
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> I didn't have any real big problems while working on this lab. It was
				sort of just like an extension of the last lab, so I was already a
				little familiar with working with libraries.</p>
			<button id="challenge-button">Press Me</button>
		</div>

		<div id="problems">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> The only problem that I had while working on this lab was getting my
				output to display my javascript. After a quick little debugging I was
				able to fix my problem, add my output to my html and display my
				functions.</p>
			<button id="problems-button">Press Me</button>
		</div>

		<div id="results">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> The results of this lab gives you three buttons that are each
				displayed below their proper section. For example, the button for
				challenges is displayed below the Challenges section.</p>
			<button id="results-button">Press Me</button>
