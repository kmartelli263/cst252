		<h1> Lab 11: Conditionals </h1>

    <h2> Challenges </h2>
    <p> I found this lab to be challenging because it had multiple steps
    to the javaScript and I found myself getting overwhelmed pretty
    easily. </p>

    <h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> The major problem I had is that I forgot to put an div id=output
    and I stared at my code for WAy too long trying to figure out why
    things weren't working correctly. I eventually figured it out. </p>

    <h2> Results </h2>
		<p> The results of this lab gives you a fun name generator for Harry
    Potter names. When you type in your full name it sorts it and outputs
    Harry Potter name for you. </p>
