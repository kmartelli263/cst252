		<h1> Lab 12: Loops </h1>

    <h2> Challenges </h2>
    <p>  My biggest challenge while working on the lap was finding time to
    do just that. I worked probably more than I should of this weekend and
  have felt sleep deprived lately.</p>

    <h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>  I am having trouble displaying my output. I am going to submit what I
    have and then resubmit my lap once I am able to figure out what is going
  wrong with my HTML and JavaScript.</p>

    <h2> Results </h2>
		<p>  The results of this lab is supposed to give you a list of all of
    numbers that you told your JavaScript to list. Also it will replace
  the numbers with words depending on what you entered for your loops in
JavScript.</p>
