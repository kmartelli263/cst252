    <h2> CHALLENGES </h2>
    <p>  My biggest challenge while working on the lap was finding time to
    do just that. I worked probably more than I should of this weekend and
    have felt sleep deprived lately.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
    <h2> PROBLEMS </h2>
		<p>  I am having trouble displaying my output. I am going to submit what I
    have and then resubmit my lap once I am able to figure out what is going
    wrong with my HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
    <h2> RESULTS </h2>
		<p>  The results of this lab is supposed to give you a list of all of
    numbers that you told your JavaScript to list. Also it will replace
    the numbers with words depending on what you entered for your loops in
    JavScript.</p>
