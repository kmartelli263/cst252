		<h1>Lab 20: JSON and API's</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> I only had one problem while working on Lab 20 and that was getting
			the caption to output onto my page. After doing a little bit of
			debugging, I soon realized that I had spelled the word "explanation"
		  wrong and I guess this was the issue because it works now!</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> The only problem I had was the one spelling error that I made which
			I explained in the section above. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> The results of this lab gives you the flexibility to output some
			pretty awesome things from the internet. I kept it simple and just
		  used the API that Wes used as an example in their lecture.</p>

		<h2>Script Output</h2>
