		<h1> Lab 6: Arrays and Objects </h1>
		<h2> Challenges </h2>
    <p> i had a really hard time creating the JavaScript functions for this lab.
    I tried looking at both Wes's code and my partners code to try and debug
  the code that I had already written, but I had no luck. For some reason
my JavaScript function will not show up on my web page and I can't seem to
figure out whats going on.</p>
    <h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> I had many problems while trying to write the javaScript code for this
    lab. The function would not display an output and I tried to debug my
  code by looking at my partners and Wes's, but I had no luck getting the
    function to show up on my web page. </p>

    <h2> Results </h2>
		<p> The results of this lab were supposed to be inputing your name or
    any group of text and to have your function mix up the letters and output
  that as your result, but unfortuantly I could not get it to work.</p>
