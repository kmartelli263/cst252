	<h2> Objective </h2>
	<p> The objective of this lab is to learn and practice pseudocoding. This is
		all new to me so I found it kind of interesting, but fun. It's always
	fun to learn new things! </p>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> The only challenge I had with this lab was how to link the JavaScript
		file to my HTML file in the head. Luckily my lab partner was able to help
		be out! </p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> The results of this lab gives you practice using pseudocoding while coding
		websites. I enjoyed taking a simple how-to list and then incorporating it
		into a web page and getting an intro into using simple JavaScript language.
