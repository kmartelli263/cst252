        <h2> Subject </h2>
        <p> The objective of this lab is to go form the prototype phase and
        structure to then using classes for the Javascript. Classes are prefered
        because they are a more capable element.
        </p>

      <div class="column">
        <h2> Challenges </h2>
        <p> this lab was pretty straight forward because it was just a more in
        depth version of the last lab. We use the last lab as a base and then
        add on to it for this lab.
